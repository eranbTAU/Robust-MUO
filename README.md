# Robust-Multi-User-Object-Recognition-Using-aWearable-Force-Myography-Device
Human-robot collaboration (HRC) in the man-ufacturing  context  aims  to  realise  a  shared  workspacewhere humans can work side by side with robots nearby.In  human-robot  collaborative  manufacturing,  robots  arerequired  to  adapt  to  human  behaviours  by  dynamicallychanging their pre-planned tasks.In this Paper, we present a novel method for recognitionobjects using a non-vision method. Our method is based onlearning Deep Neural Networks, we developed a new archi-tecture “Flip-U-NET” that based on the familiar architecture“U-Net” which is used for segmentation in the medical field.The new architecture tries to solve the problem of robust-ness in the field of recognition. We have developed a noveldesign  for  a  lightweight  wearable  device  that  will  senseand record the dominating features during tasks. Recordeddata will be applied in data-driven modeling approaches tomodel the human arm in various tasks, this while reasoningabout uncertainties and sensory noise.
